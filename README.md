This project is part of the COS 214 course and aims to develop a dynamic simulation of urban growth, resource management, and citizen satisfaction using C++. 🚧

## 📝 Project Overview
Urbanization is at the core of human civilization, and managing the growth and sustainability of cities requires balancing infrastructure, resources, and citizen needs. In this project, we’ve created a City Builder Simulation where players can design, construct, and manage a thriving city.

The system focuses on:

* **Building and managing urban infrastructure** (residential, commercial, industrial, and landmarks).
* **Allocating resources** like power, water, and waste management.
* **Managing citizen satisfaction** based on taxes, amenities, and services.
* **Dynamic interactions** between buildings, utilities, citizens, and government.

### 🔑 Features
* 🏗️ **Construct Buildings**: Create and manage various types of buildings, each with its own impact on the city.
* 🚦 **Manage Transportation**: Build roads, public transport systems, and manage traffic flow.
* ⚡ **Resource Management**: Provide utilities like electricity and water to your city and handle shortages or surpluses.
* 👥 **Citizen Simulation**: Model population growth, employment, and satisfaction based on policies.
* 📊 **Taxation and Governance**: Set and adjust taxes, allocate city budgets, and implement policies to keep citizens happy and the city running smoothly.

### 📅 Important Dates
* **15 October**: Initial Design (Practical 6) submission.
* **22-23 October**: Updated Design Review and Skeleton Implementation.
* **4 November**: Final project submission.
* **5-6 November**: Project demos.
